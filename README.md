# simple-bank-account
My first small python project I am using as a test to push onto github!

This is a simple command-line bank account tracker, it doesn't keep track of any purchases, but it does keep track of how much money you are at, so this program is kind of useless. However this is more for my practice and I hope to create a GUI for this program one day along with something to keep track of where/when the money was deposited and withdrawed.
